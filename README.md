# Level Up

## Aynchronous programming

- Futureverse {[website](https://www.futureverse.org/)} - future {[github](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future)} {[website](https://future.futureverse.org/)} and promises {[github](https://github.com/rstudio/promises/)} {[website](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/)}
  - A future is an abstraction for a value that may be available at some point in the future. The state of a future can either be unresolved or resolved
  - A future always returns a promise. It stores the state of a future to be evaluated later in the r shiny workflow.  
- callr {[github](https://github.com/r-lib/callr)} - Perform a computation in a separate R process, without affecting the current R process at all.
- Parallelization: 
  - parallelly: Enhancing the 'parallel' Package {[github](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/parallelly)}
  - ParallelLogger: Support for parallel computation with progress bar, and option to stop or proceed on errors {[github](https://github.com/OHDSI/ParallelLogger)}
  - Reference reads 
    - R Programming for Data Science - Parallel Computation {[book](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/parallel-computation.html)}
    - R (BGU course) - Parallel Computing {[book](https://www.john-ros.com/Rcourse/parallel.html)}
    - Quick Intro to Parallel Computing in R by Matt Jones {[blog](https://nceas.github.io/oss-lessons/parallel-computing-in-r/parallel-computing-in-r.html)}
    - Parallelized loops with R {[blog](https://www.blasbenito.com/post/02_parallelizing_loops_with_r/)}
- coro {[github](https://github.com/r-lib/coro)} - Implements coroutines for R, i.e. functions that can be suspended and resumed later on
