## Aynchronous programming ü™Ç

- `Futureverse` {[website](https://www.futureverse.org/)} - `future` {[github](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future)} {[website](https://future.futureverse.org/)} and `promises` {[github](https://github.com/rstudio/promises/)} {[website](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/)}
  - A `future` is an abstraction for a value that may be available at some point in the future. The state of a future can either be unresolved or resolved
  - A `future` always returns a promise. It stores the state of a future to be evaluated later in the r shiny workflow.  
- `callr` {[github](https://github.com/r-lib/callr)} - Perform a computation in a separate R process, without affecting the current R process at all.
- Parallelization: 
  - `parallelly`: Enhancing the 'parallel' Package {[github](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/parallelly)}
